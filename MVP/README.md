# Price_Indicator_Analysis (MVP)

Analysis of common technical analysis indicators on daily price data for different products.

## Goals

This analysis is being done to explore whether or not certain technical analysis indicators can consistently predict future price movements in various actively traded products.  Three common trading strategies include trend-following, break-out, and mean-reversion.  This project will explore indicators in each category and determine their individual predictive value over different timeframes.

## Data Collection and Cleaning

In order to get data from more traditional products and newer assets, I will be extracting data from both Quandl and Cryptocompare.  Each has its own API that is freely available, Quandl even has a package to be used specifically with Python.
